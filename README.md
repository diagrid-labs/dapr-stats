## Running the CollectDaprStats program

The program is run in a GitHub Codespace on the 1st and 16th of each month.

1. Start the .NET service:

    ``` bash
    dapr run -f .
    ```

2. Run the `CollectorWorkflow` workflow via the Dapr http endpoint. Use the [local-test.http](local-tests.http) file with the VSCode REST client (should be pre-configured with the Codespace).

    ```http
    POST {{dapr_url}}/v1.0-beta1/workflows/dapr/CollectorWorkflow/start?instanceID={{workflow_id}}
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "CollectionDate" : "{{currentDate}}",
        "CollectNuGetData" : true,
        "CollectNpmData" : true,
        "CollectPythonData" : true,
        "CollectDiscordData" : true,
        "CollectGitHubData" : true
    }
    ```
